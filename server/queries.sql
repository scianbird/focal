  -- I knew the next step was going to be the most time-consuming one, but it was also important for me to have alt tags and to have images that would lend themselves to the visual theme of the app. Although I couldn't really satisfy my goal with the second point (as I was relying on all free images, and all from unsplash for the sake of keeping it simple) I at least have written decent/helpful alt text for every image. I then added the foreign key relationship between images and eng using the GUI in supabase so that I could keep track of it all visually
